# Neural-Network-from-scratch-with-MNIST-implementation
This project aims to implement Neural networks from scratch using Python, and Numpy for arrays. It is a simple approach to learning how Neural networks work. Note: I have followed the tutorial of Samson Zhang to build this.  

Update: I am working on improving the accuracy as it is too low. I might build this again with more layers.
