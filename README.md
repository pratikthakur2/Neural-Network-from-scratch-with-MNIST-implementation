# Neural-Network-from-scratch-with-MNIST-implementation
This project aims to implement Neural networks from scratch using Python, Numpy for arrays. It is a simple approach to learn how Neural networks actually work. Note: I have followed the tutorial of Samson Zhang to build this.  

Update: I am currently working on this to improve it as the accuracy is poor. I might try to build it again with more layers maybe.
